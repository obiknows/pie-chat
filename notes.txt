#//server

The server maintains a table with the IP addresses, port numbers,
and nick-names of all the clients.

#//client

Every client should also maintain a local table with information about
all the other clients (nick-name, ip, port number, online-status).

Every client should update (overwrite) its local table when the server sends
information about all the other clients
(further detail on this in upcoming section).
